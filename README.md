# Mapping-Sleep-Patterns
Mapping and visualizing the sleep patterns and schedule of my (now) 3 year old from ages 2 months to 2 years.
My child's daycare sends me data on my childs napping. I plotted said data as a stacked bar to observe frequency and length of her naps.

I also plotted a box plot for each month to observe any over arching trends. The dip in December of 2019 is her 1 year sleep regression and also coincides with a periods of frequent travel.

I plotted a 3D bar chart to get a sense of how her nap schedule looked like when she was napping multiple times a day (i.e. time in between naps / nap frequency)
